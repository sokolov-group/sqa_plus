# sqa_extra: SecondQuantizationAlgebra Plus

This program is intended to automate many of the tedious manipulations that one encounters when working in second quantization.
To use it, be sure that your ```$PYTHONPATH``` variable includes this directory.
Then, in the Python2 interpreter or in a Python2 script, use a command such as:

```python
import secondQuantizationAlgebra as sqa
```
